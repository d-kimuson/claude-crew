# Claude Crew Contributor Guide

This document is a guide explaining how to contribute to the Claude Crew project. We welcome all forms of contributions, including code improvements, bug fixes, and new feature additions.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version specified in the `.node-version` file)
- pnpm (version specified in the `packageManager` field of the project root's `package.json`)
- Docker (for PostgreSQL, optional)

### Setup Steps

1.  Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/d-kimuson/claude-crew.git
    cd claude-crew
    ```

2.  Install dependencies
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

Your development environment is now ready.

## Development Workflow

### Build

Use the `pnpm build` command to build the project. This compiles TypeScript code and generates executable JavaScript files in the `dist/` directory.

### Running the CLI

There are several ways to run CLI commands during development.

- **`pnpm cli <command>`**: Directly executes TypeScript source without building. Useful for quick testing during development cycles.
  ```bash
  pnpm cli setup
  pnpm cli setup-db /path/to/config.json
  ```
- **Post-build execution**: Directly run the `dist/cli.js` generated by `pnpm build` with Node.js. Suitable for testing in an environment closer to production.
  ```bash
  node ./dist/cli.js serve-mcp ./.claude-crew/config.json
  ```
- **`npx` equivalent test**: Run the `scripts/test-npx.sh` script to locally verify behavior when the package is installed and executed via `npx`.

### Testing and Quality Checks

The following commands are available to maintain code quality. Please run them before submitting a Pull Request.

- **Unit Tests**: `pnpm test` (using Vitest)
- **Linter**: `pnpm lint` (using ESLint, Prettier, CSpell)
- **Type Check**: `pnpm typecheck`

You can find all available test and quality check commands in the `scripts` section of `package.json`. Auto-fix (`pnpm fix`) is also available.

## Coding Conventions

Please refer to the [Coding Guidelines](./coding-guidelines.md).

## Submitting Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2.  Create a new branch with a name appropriate for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3.  Make your code changes.
4.  Add or update related tests and ensure all tests (`pnpm test`) and quality checks (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`) pass.
5.  Commit your changes. It is recommended to follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages.
6.  Push the branch to your forked repository.
7.  Create a Pull Request against the original repository on GitHub.
    - Write the Pull Request title and description clearly explaining your changes.
    - Link to related issues if any exist.
    - If needed, include notes for reviewers about specific points to check or testing methods.

After review, if there are no issues, your changes will be merged. Thank you for your contribution!
