Claude Crew is a tool for creating autonomous coding agents like OpenHands using Claude Desktop and Model Context Protocol (MCP). Unlike coding assistants like Cline that focus on real-time collaboration, Claude Crew aims to create agents that can process tasks autonomously.

## Concept

Claude Crew focuses on three key elements to maximize LLM performance:

- üéØ Maximizing cost efficiency through efficient context window usage
- üß™ Prioritizing operation verification through unit testing over browser integration for better token cost performance
- üîÑ Providing project-optimized MCP and context information rather than generic filesystem operations and shell MCP

## Requirements

- Claude Desktop
- OpenAI API key for embedding (Optional: can use local embedding with Xenova instead)
- Docker and Docker Compose (Not required when using custom database)
- Node.js >= v20

## Features

- üöÄ Easy setup through interactive dialog
- üîÑ Smooth integration with Claude Desktop
- üìù Automatic instruction generation for Claude Projects
- üõ†Ô∏è Customizable project workflow commands
- üåê Multi-language support (Full TypeScript support, basic file operations for other languages)
- üîç Enhanced context understanding through local embedding (supports both OpenAI and Xenova)
- üí™ High-precision TypeScript support utilizing type information
- üîå Support for custom PostgreSQL database instead of Docker

## Quick Start

### Project Setup

Move to your project directory and run the setup:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
npx claude-crew@latest setup
```

Configuration files will be generated under `.claude-crew` through an interactive setup process.

### Claude Desktop Setup

1. Add the MCP settings from `.claude-crew/mcp.json` to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
2. Launch Claude Desktop and create a new Project
3. Add the content of `.claude-crew/instruction.md` to the project's custom instructions

Setup complete! üéâ

## How it works

Claude Crew processes tasks in the following flow:

1. **Task Reception**

   - Receive task requests from users

2. **Project Information Provision**

   - `prepare` tool is automatically invoked to:
     - Create a working branch
     - Update project to latest state
     - Resolve dependencies
   - Provide LLM with:
     - Project structure
     - Related source code
     - Related documentation
     - Test environment information

3. **Autonomous Task Execution**
   - LLM starts working based on provided information
   - Automatic file operations include:
     - Linter code quality checks
     - Unit test execution
     - Type checking
   - Implement necessary corrections based on feedback results
   - Create commits and propose pull requests

Information obtained at each step is optimized for efficient use of the LLM's context window.
